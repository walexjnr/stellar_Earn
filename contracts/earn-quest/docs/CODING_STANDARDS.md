# Soroban Coding Standards

## Patterns

| Pattern | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Auth | Always call `address.require_auth()` before mutating state. |
| Storage | Prefer `instance` for global config, `persistent` for per-user data. |
| Errors | Use `panic_with_error!` with typed error enums; never use `unwrap()` in production paths. |
| Events | Emit events for every state-changing operation using `env.events().publish`. |
| Overflow | Use `checked_add` / `checked_sub` / `saturating_*` for all arithmetic. |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why to Avoid |
|---|---|
| `unwrap()` on storage reads | Panics with an opaque error; use `unwrap_or_else` with a typed error. |
| Unbounded loops | Can exceed instruction limits; cap iteration with a max batch size. |
| Storing large blobs | Increases ledger fees; store hashes or off-chain references instead. |
| Re-entrancy via cross-contract calls | Use a re-entrancy guard (`nonreentrant_enter/exit`) around external calls. |
| Skipping version checks on upgrade | Always enforce `new_version > current_version` before applying WASM upgrades. |
